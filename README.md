# README

This code performs two tasks:

* Part A: Reads a JSON file of books and prints a table of books by authors starting with F, as well as the number of years since each book was published.
* Part B: Reads a text file of apartment prices and performs linear regression to predict the price of an apartment based on its features.

## Instructions

    python main.py

</div>

This will run the code and print the results to the console.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into two parts:

* Part A: The `loadjson()` and `F_authors()` functions in the `main.py` file.
* Part B: The `loadTextFile()`, `splitData()`, `linearRegression()`, and `evaluateModel()` functions in the `main.py` file.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.6 or higher
